Instead of averaging client models equally, each client's contribution was weighted based on the size of its local dataset. This ensured a more accurate and fair update of the global model. The approach was integrated into the training loop and executed successfully across multiple rounds."

We improved the model architecture with a deeper MLP and increased the training rounds to 50 and local epochs to 20. This setup significantly boosted performance, reaching a test accuracy of 50.40% on a 12-class classification task. The weighted averaging strategy (FedAvg) ensured fair contribution from clients based on their dataset sizes. Despite data heterogeneity, the model was able to learn meaningful patterns collaboratively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of FL in preserving privacy while maintaining competitive performance."
